# Phase 2 Implementation Summary

## What We Accomplished

Phase 2 of the Doppler SDK consolidation focused on implementing static auctions (formerly V3). Here's what was completed:

### 1. Core ABIs
- Created a consolidated `src/abis/index.ts` file with all necessary contract ABIs
- Included ABIs for: Airlock, UniswapV3Initializer, V2/V3/V4 Migrators, UniswapV3Pool, and DERC20
- Structured ABIs using const assertions for type safety

### 2. DopplerFactory Implementation
- **createStaticAuction method**: Full implementation that:
  - Validates all input parameters
  - Encodes pool initializer data for Uniswap V3
  - Handles all three migration types (V2, V3, V4)
  - Generates unique salts for deployment
  - Prepares token parameters with vesting support

- **encodeMigrationData method**: Handles encoding for all migration types:
  - V2: Simple migration with empty data
  - V3: Encodes fee and tick spacing
  - V4: Complex encoding with streamable fees configuration, including beneficiary validation and sorting

- **Validation**: Comprehensive parameter validation including:
  - Token name/symbol requirements
  - Tick range validation
  - Sale configuration checks
  - Vesting validation
  - Migration-specific validations (e.g., beneficiary percentages for V4)

### 3. Type-Safe Migration Configuration
The new discriminated union `MigrationConfig` makes the API much clearer:

```typescript
// Before (confusing): manually encoding hex data
const v4MigratorData = await factory.encodeV4MigratorData({...})
await factory.create({ 
  liquidityMigratorData: v4MigratorData,
  liquidityMigrator: addresses.liquidityMigrator // which one?
})

// After (clear): type-safe configuration
migration: {
  type: 'uniswapV4',
  fee: 3000,
  tickSpacing: 60,
  streamableFees: {
    lockDuration: 365 * 24 * 60 * 60,
    beneficiaries: [...]
  }
}
```

### 4. Example Usage
Created a comprehensive example showing:
- How to create a static auction with V4 migration and streamable fees
- How to create a simple static auction with V2 migration
- The improved developer experience with the new API

## What's Still Needed

While the core static auction logic is implemented, the following pieces are still required:

1. **Contract Interaction**: The actual blockchain calls need to be implemented once we set up the viem client integration
2. **StaticAuction Methods**: Implement the methods in `StaticAuction.ts` for interacting with deployed auctions
3. **Helper Functions**: Add utilities for tick calculations, price conversions, etc.

## Key Improvements Over V3 SDK

1. **Clearer Terminology**: "Static Auction" instead of "V3"
2. **Type-Safe Configuration**: Discriminated unions for migration config
3. **Better Validation**: Comprehensive parameter checking with clear error messages
4. **Unified API**: Single factory for all auction types
5. **Simplified Integration**: No need to manually encode complex hex data

The implementation successfully abstracts away the complexity of the underlying protocols while maintaining full functionality.
