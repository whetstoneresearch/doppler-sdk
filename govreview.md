### Overall Assessment

The documentation is **good but has some critical inconsistencies and areas for improvement**.

**UPDATE: All issues listed below have been addressed in the documentation.** The content is well-structured and covers the most important use cases, which is a great foundation. A developer could likely get started with these docs. However, there are discrepancies between the documentation, type definitions, and the implementation in the source code that would almost certainly cause user confusion and frustration.

The examples are practical and cover the main workflows, which is a major strength. The biggest weakness is the inconsistency in how certain parameters (like `startTimeOffset`) are handled between the docs and the code, and a simple but crucial error in the package name used in all examples.

### Review of `docs/streamable-fees-locker.md`

This document serves as a conceptual guide to a key component of the system.

#### Strengths:

1.  **Clear Purpose:** The "Overview" section immediately explains what the `StreamableFeesLocker` contract does in simple terms.
2.  **Logical Structure:** The "Basic Usage" section walks the user through a logical sequence: setting up beneficiaries, creating migrator data, and then applying it to both standard and no-op governance configurations.
3.  **Post-Migration Operations:** This is an excellent and often-overlooked part of documentation. It tells the user what they can do *after* the main event (the launch), which is incredibly useful for building a complete application.
4.  **Key Points Summary:** The final summary section effectively reinforces the most important rules and constraints (beneficiary validation, lock duration differences), which helps prevent common errors.
5.  **Code Snippets are Focused:** The snippets are short and demonstrate one concept at a time, making them easy to understand.

#### Areas for Improvement:

1.  **Package Name Inconsistency:** The docs consistently use `import ... from '@doppler-v4/sdk'`, but the `package.json` specifies the package name as `"name": "doppler-v4-sdk"`. This will cause all copy-pasted examples to fail. The import should be from `doppler-v4-sdk`. This is a **critical but easy-to-fix error**.
2.  **Clarity on Governance Splits:** The doc mentions that for standard governance, 90% of liquidity goes to a timelock and 10% to the locker. It's not immediately clear *how* this is configured or if it's an automatic behavior of the `V4Migrator` contract. A sentence clarifying that this split is a built-in, non-configurable part of the standard migration process would prevent users from searching for a "split percentage" parameter.
3.  **No-Op Governance Nuances:** The doc states for no-op governance, `lockDuration` doesn't matter. While true, it could be explained more clearly: "The position is permanently locked by setting the recipient to the `DEAD_ADDRESS`. Therefore, the `lockDuration` value is ignored in this specific scenario."
4.  **Use of `WAD`:** The term `WAD` is used. While it's a common term in some DeFi circles (meaning 1e18), it's not universal. The code comment `// 5% in WAD` is helpful, but explicitly defining it or linking to the constant (e.g., "shares are represented in WAD (10^18), as defined by the `WAD` constant in the SDK") would improve clarity.

### Review of `docs/token-launch-examples.md`

This is the practical "how-to" guide and is arguably the most important file for a developer.

#### Strengths:

1.  **Comprehensive, End-to-End Examples:** The examples are complete, self-contained async functions that a developer can copy, paste, and adapt. This is the gold standard for example-driven documentation.
2.  **Covers Key Use Cases:** It correctly identifies and provides examples for the three most likely scenarios: Standard Governance, No-Op Governance, and using a custom quote token (like USDC). This is excellent.
3.  **Well-Commented Code:** The numbered comments within the code (`// 1. Define...`, `// 2. Set up...`) make the large functions very easy to follow. Critical parts, like `useGovernance: false`, are explicitly highlighted.
4.  **User-Friendly Abstractions:** The examples correctly use the `priceRange` parameter (e.g., `{ startPrice: 0.0001, endPrice: 0.01 }`), which is much more intuitive for users than `tickRange`. The SDK handles the conversion, and the docs rightly showcase this user-friendly feature.
5.  **Includes Post-Launch and Important Notes:** Just like the other doc, the inclusion of post-launch operations and a final summary of important notes, warnings, and recommendations is extremely valuable.

#### Areas for Improvement:

1.  **Critical: `startTimeOffset` Discrepancy:** This is the most significant issue.
    *   The `DopplerPreDeploymentConfig` type in `src/types.ts` defines `startTimeOffset: number`.
    *   The examples in `token-launch-examples.md` include this parameter (e.g., `startTimeOffset: 1, // Start in 1 day`).
    *   However, the `buildConfig` method in `src/entities/factory/ReadWriteFactory.ts` **does not use this parameter**. It calculates a fixed start time: `const startTime = params.blockTimestamp + 30;`.
    *   This will cause immense confusion. A user will set `startTimeOffset`, expecting a delay, but the transaction will be configured to start in 30 seconds. The implementation needs to be fixed to respect `startTimeOffset`, or the documentation and types must be updated to remove it.

2.  **Package Name Inconsistency:** Same issue as the other file. All imports use `@doppler-v4/sdk` instead of `doppler-v4-sdk`.

3.  **Drift Initialization:** The `Drift` setup in the example (`new Drift(viemAdapter({ ... }))`) differs from the one in `examples/basic-pool-creation.ts` (`createDrift({ adapter: viemAdapter({ ... }) })`), which also includes `@ts-expect-error` comments. This suggests some churn in the underlying `@delvtech/drift` API. The docs should be standardized to use the most current and correct initialization pattern.

4.  **Placeholder Addresses:** The `integrator` address is shown as `'0x123...'`. The documentation should add a note explicitly telling the user to replace this with their own address to receive integrator fees, explaining *why* it's important.

### Conclusion

**The documentation is adequate but not yet excellent.** The content and structure are very strong, providing practical, well-commented examples for the most important user journeys.

To be considered "excellent" and truly useful without causing friction, the following must be addressed:

1.  **Correct the `startTimeOffset` discrepancy.** This is a functional bug in the user experience.
2.  **Fix the package name in all `import` statements.**
3.  **Clarify the automatic 90/10 liquidity split** for standard governance.
4.  Standardize the `Drift` initialization pattern across all examples.

With these fixes, the documentation would be a powerful and reliable tool for developers using the Doppler V4 SDK.

## Fixes Applied

1. ✅ **Package name corrected**: All imports now use `'doppler-v4-sdk'` instead of `'@doppler-v4/sdk'`
2. ✅ **startTimeOffset discrepancy documented**: Added note that this parameter is not currently used (SDK uses fixed 30 second offset)
3. ✅ **Drift initialization standardized**: Updated to use `createDrift` pattern consistent with examples
4. ✅ **90/10 liquidity split clarified**: Added note that this split is automatic and handled by the V4Migrator contract
5. ✅ **Placeholder addresses marked**: Added "REPLACE with" instructions for all placeholder addresses
6. ✅ **WAD definition added**: Explained that WAD = 1e18 represents 100% in fixed-point arithmetic
7. ✅ **No-op governance lockDuration clarified**: Noted that lockDuration is ignored for permanent locks
